This tutorial reviews how to add and commit changes to a git repository.

<div id="objectives" markdown="1">
# Learning Objectives
At the end of this activity, you will be able to:

* Add new files or changes to existing files to your repo.
* Document changes using the `commit` command with a message describing what has changed.
* Describe the difference between `git add` and `git commit`.
* Sync changes to your local repository with the repostored on GitHub.com.
* Use and interpret the output from the following commands:
  + `git status`
  + `git add`
  + `git commit`
  + `git push`

In the previous lesson, we created a markdown (`.md`) file in our forked version
of the `DI16-NEON` main repo. In order for Git to recognize this new file and
track it, we need to:

1. Add it to the repository using `git add`.
2. Commit it to the repository as a set of changes (in this case, a new document
  with some text content).
3. Sync the changes we made locally, to our forked repo hosted on github.com.

 <figcaption>Once you have cloned your repo to your computer, you don't have to
 do it again. You can now work on any file in the repo, locally. You use "Git pull" to pull changes in your fork on GitHub.com down
 to your computer to ensure both repos are in sync. Edits to a file on your
  computer are not recognized by git until you "add" and "commit" them as 
 tracked changes in your repo.

## Check Repository Status -- git status

Let's first run through some basic commands to get going with Git at the command
 line. First, it's always a good idea to check the status of your repository.
 This allows us to see any untracked changes that have occurred, and what is
 being tracked / not currently being tracked.

Do the following:

1. Open bash if it's not already open.
2. Navigate to the `DI16-NEON-participants` repository in bash.
3. Type: `git status`.

The commands that you type into bash should look like the code below:

    # Change directory
    # The directory containing the git repo that you wish to work in.
    $ cd ~/Documents/GitHub/neon-data-repository-2016

    # check the status of the repo
    $ git status

Output:

    On branch gh-pages
    Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/gh-pages'.
    Changes not staged for commit:
     (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
     (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

    Untracked files:
     (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

    _posts/ExampleFile.md


Let's make sense of the output of the `git status` command.

* `On branch gh-pages`: This tells us that we are on the gh-pages branch or the
repository. Don't worry too much about branches just yet. We will work on the gh-pages branch
throughout the Data Institute. (see Additional Resources section for more on branches).
* `Changes not staged for commit:` This lists any file(s) that is/are  currently
being tracked by git BUT have new **changes** that need to be added for git to track.
* `Untracked file:` These are all **new files** that have never been added to or
tracked by Git.

## Add Markdown File - git add

Next, let's add the markdown file containing our bio and short project summary
using the command `git add FileName.md`.

    # add a file, so that changes are tracked
    $ git add ExampleFile.md

    # check status again
    $ git status

    On branch gh-pages
    Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/gh-pages'.
    Changes to be committed:
     (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

    	new file:  _posts/ExampleFile.md


Understand the output:

*  `Changes to be committed:` This lists the new files or files with changes that
have been added to the git tracking system but need to be COMMITTED as actual changes
in the git repository history.

## Commit Changes - git commit

When we add a file at the command line. We are telling git to recognize that
a change has occurred. The file moves to what's called "staging" where git
recognizes a change has happened however, the change has not yet been formally
documented. When we want to permanently document those changes, we have to
`commit` the change. A single commit will work for all files that are currently
`staged` in the git bash environment (anything in green when we check the status).

### Commit messages

When we commit a change to the git tracking system, we need to add a commit
message. This message describes the changes made in that commit.

Note: It is good practice to keep commit messages to <50 characters.


    # commit changes with message
    $ git commit -m “new example file for demonstration”

    [gh-pages e3cd622] new example file for demonstration
     1 file changed, 56 insertions(+), 4 deletions(-)
     create mode 100644 _posts/ExampleFile.md


**Understand the output:**
Each commit will look slightly different but the important parts include:

*  `gh-pages xxxxxxx` this is the unique identifier for this set of changes or
this commit. You will always be able to track this specific commit (this specific
 set of changes) using this identifier.
* `_ file change, _ insertions(+), _ deletion (-)` this tells you how many files
have changed and the number of type of changes made to the files including: insertions,
and deletions.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:**
It is a good idea to use "git status" frequently as you are working with git
in the shell. This allows you to keep track of change that you've made, and also
what git is actually tracking.

## Why Add, then Commit?

	<figcaption> You can think of Git as taking snapshots of changes over the
life of a project. git add specifies what will go in a snapshot (putting things
 in the staging area), and git commit then actually takes the snapshot, and
 makes a permanent record of it (as a commit). Image and caption source:

To understand what is going on with `git add` and `git commit` it is important
to understand that Git has a staging area that we add items to with `git add`.
Changes are not actually documented and permanently tracked
until we actually commit them. This allows
us to commit specific groups of files at the same time, if we wish. For instance,
we may decide to add and commit all R scripts together. And markdown files in another,
separate commit.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Bonus Tip:** You can use Git and connect to GitHub
directly in the RStudio interface. If interested, read

## Transfer Changes (Commits) from your Local Repo to GitHub Repo - git push

When we are done editing our files and have committed the changes locally, we
are ready to transfer or sync these changes to our forked repo on github.com. To
do this we need to push our changes from the local git version control to the
 remote GitHub repo.

We sync local changes with github.com, we can do the following:

1. Check the status of our repo using `git status`. Are all of the changes "added"
and committed to the repo?
2. Use `git push origin/gh-pages`. `origin` tells git to push the files to the
originating repo. In this case, this is the repo that we cloned originally.
`gh-pages` is the repo branch that you are currently working on.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:**
Note about branches in Git: We won't covered branches in these tutorials. However,
a git repo can consist of many branches. A branch is almost like a directory where
you can work on changes and updates to a repo. For the data institute, we will
 always use the gh-pages branch which allows us to quickly place content online
 (more to come about this at the Institute!). The default branch for a git repo
 is called  "Master".
{: .notice }

Let's push the changes that we made to the local version of our git repo,
to our account at github.com:

    # check the repo status
    $ git status

    On branch gh-pages
    Your branch is ahead of 'origin/gh-pages' by 1 commit.
      (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

    # transfer committed changes to the forked repo
    git push origin/gh-pages

    Counting objects: 1, done.
    Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
    Compressing objects: 100% (6/6), done.
    Writing objects: 100% (6/6), 1.51 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
    Total 6 (delta 4), reused 0 (delta 0)
    To https://github.com/NEON-WorkWithData/DI16-NEON-participants.git
       5022aca..e3cd622  gh-pages -> gh-pages


NOTE: you may be asked for your username and password! This is your github.com
username and password.

Understand the output: Pay attention to the repository URL - the "origin" is the
repository that the commit was pushed to, here `https://github.com/NEON-WorkWithData/DI16-NEON-participants.git`.
Note that because this repo is a fork, your URL will have your github username in it
as follows:

`https://github.com/your-user-name/DI16-NEON-participants`


## View Commits in GitHub

Let’s view our recent commit in our forked GitHub repo.

* From the github.com website, navigate to your forked Institute repo.
* Click on the "commits" link at the top of the page.
* Look at the commits - do you see your recent commit message that you typed
into bash on your computer?

Look at your fork of the DI16-NEON-participants, is the markdown file that you
added and committed in bash there?

* Next, navigate to the MAIN <a href="https://github.com/NEON-WorkWithData/DI16-NEON-participants" target="_blank">NEON-WorkWithData/DI16-NEON-participants repo </a>from which
 your repo is forked. (The easiest method to do this is to click the link at the
 top of the page under your repo name).
 * Is your new file there? Why not?

Remember the structure of our workflow. You’ve synced your local repository
with your forked version of the Institute repository. But forks are entirely
separate from the repo that they were forked from. Changes to one do not
affect the other unless they are synced. We will learn how to sync these two
repos in the next tutorial [Syncing GitHub Repos with Pull Requests]({{ site.baseurl}}//tutorial-series/pre-institute2/git06).

## Summary workflow - Committing Changes

On your computer, within your local copy of the git repo:

* Modify, create, or delete document(s) or repo structure.

On your computer, in shell:

* `git status`
* `git add FileName`
* `git status` - make sure everything is added and ready for commit
* `git commit -m “messageHere”
* `git push origin/gh-pages`

On the GitHub.com website:

* Check to make sure commit is added.
* Check to see if the file that you added, is visible online in your git repo.
