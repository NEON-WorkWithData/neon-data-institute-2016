=============

This lesson teaches some tips and tricks that will make life easier with R Markdown if one is using it in the context of a typical research project, which will likely involve multiple sources of raw data that are then combined to create multiple intermediate datasets which then get combined to generate figures and tables.

## Before the lesson starts

* Make sure that participants have the following packages installed:
  - knitr
  - dplyr
  - testthat
  - ggplot2
  - rmarkdown and knitr (in RStudio pushing the knit HTML button the first time will
    prompt to have these packages installed)

* Distribute a Zip file that only contains the content of the
  `example-manuscript` folder from this repository.

* Explain what the handout file contains
