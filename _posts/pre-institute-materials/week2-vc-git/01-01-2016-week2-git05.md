This tutorial reviews how to add and commit changes to a git repository.

<div id="objectives" markdown="1">
# Learning Objectives
At the end of this activity, you will be able to:

* Add new files or changes to existing files to your repository.
* Document changes using the `commit` command with a message describing what has changed.
* Describe the difference between `git add` and `git commit`.
* Sync changes to your local repository with the repository stored on GitHub.com.
* Use and interpret the output from the following commands:
  + `git status`
  + `git add`
  + `git commit`
  + `git push`

In the previous lesson, we created a markdown (.md) file in our DI16-NEON repository.
In order for Git to recognize this new file and track it, we need to:

1. Formally add it to the repository using `git add`
2. Commit it to the repository as a set of changes (in this case, a new document).
3. Sync the changes we made locally, to our repository hosted on github.com.

## Check Repository Status -- git status

Let's run through some basic commands to get going with Git at the command line.
First, it's always a good idea to check the status of your repository. This allows
us to see any changes that have occured and what hasn't been added to the repository.

Do the following:

1. Open bash
2. Navigate to the `DI16-NEON-participants` repository in bash
3. Type: `git status`

The commands that you type into bash should look like the code below:

    # Change directory
    # The directory containing the git repo that you wish to work in.
    $ cd ~/Documents/GitHub/neon-data-repository-2016

    # check the status of the repo
    $ git status

Output:

    On branch gh-pages
    Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/gh-pages'.
    Changes not staged for commit:
     (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
     (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:  _config.yml

    Untracked files:
     (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

  	_posts/ExampleFile.md


Let's make sense of the output of the `git status` command.

* `On branch gh-pages` - This tells us that we are on the gh-pages branch or the
repository. Don't worry too much about branches just yet. We will work on the gh-pages branch
throughout the Data Institute.  (see Additional Resources section for more on branches).
* `Changes not staged for commit:` This lists any file(s) that is/are  currently
being tracked by git BUT have new **changes** that need to be added for git to track.
* `Untracked file:` These are all **new files** that have never been added to or
tracked by Git.

## Add Markdown File - git add

Next, let's add the markdown file containing our bio and short project summary
using the command `git add FileName.md`.

    # add a file, so that changes are tracked
    $ git add ExampleFile.md

    # check status again
    $ git status

    On branch gh-pages
    Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/gh-pages'.
    Changes to be committed:
     (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

    	new file:  _posts/ExampleFile.md



Understand the output:

*  `Changes to be committed:` This lists the new files or files with changes that
have been added to the git tracking system but need to be COMMITTED as actual changes
in the git repository history.

## Commit Changes - git commit

When we add a file at the command line. We are just telling git to recognize that
a change has occurred. However, when we want to permanently document those changes
to the git repository, we have to
`commit` the change. A single commit will work for all files that are currently
added in the git bash environment (anything in green when we check the status).

### Commit messages

When we commit a change to be tracked by git, we need to add a commit message.
This message describes the changes made in that commit.

Note: It is often recommended to keep commit messages to <50 characters.


    # commit changes with message
    $ git commit -m “new example file for demonstration”

    [gh-pages e3cd622] new example file for demonstration
     1 file changed, 56 insertions(+), 4 deletions(-)
     create mode 100644 _posts/ExampleFile.md


Understand the output: each commit will look slightly different but the
important parts include:

*  `gh-pages xxxxxxx` this is the unique identifier for this set of changes or this
commit. You will always be able to track this specific commit (this specific set of changes)
using this identifier.
* `_ file change, _ insertions(+), _ deletion (-)` this tells you how many files
have changed and the number of type of changes made to the files including: insertions,
and deletions.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:**
It is a good idea to use "git status" frequently as you are working with git
in the shell. This allows you to make sure that changes that you have made are actually
being added and tracked by git!

## Why Add, then Commit?

	<figcaption> You can think of Git as taking snapshots of changes over the
life of a project. git add specifies what will go in a snapshot (putting things
 in the staging area), and git commit then actually takes the snapshot, and
 makes a permanent record of it (as a commit). Image and caption source:

</figure>

To understand what is going on with `git add` and `git commit` it is important
to understand that Git has a staging area that we add items to with `git add`.
Changes are not actually documented and permanently tracked
until we actually commit them. This allows
us to commit specific groups of files at the same time, if we wish. For instance,
we may decide to add and commit all R scripts together. And markdown files in another,
separate commit.

## Transfer Changes (Commits) from your Local Repo to GitHub Repo - git push

When we are done editing our files and have committed the changes locally, we
are ready to transfer or sync these changes to github.com. To do this
 we need to push our changes from the local git version control to the remote
GitHub repo.

We sync local changes with github.com, we can do the following:

1. Check the status of our repo using `git status`. Are all of the changes "added"
and committed to the repo?
2. Use `git push origin/gh-pages`. `origin` tells git to push the files to the
originating repo. In this case, this is the repo that we cloned originally.
`gh-pages` is the repo branch that you are currently working on. We will always
use gh-pages for the Institute.

Let's give this a go:

    # check the repo status
    $ git status

    On branch gh-pages
    Your branch is ahead of 'origin/gh-pages' by 1 commit.
      (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

    # transfer committed changes to the forked repo
    git push origin/gh-pages

    Counting objects: 1, done.
    Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
    Compressing objects: 100% (6/6), done.
    Writing objects: 100% (6/6), 1.51 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
    Total 6 (delta 4), reused 0 (delta 0)
    To https://github.com/NEON-WorkWithData/DI16-NEON-participants.git
       5022aca..e3cd622  gh-pages -> gh-pages


Understand the output: Pay attention to the repository URL - the "origin" is the 
repository that the commit was pushed to, here `https://github.com/NEON-WorkWithData/DI16-NEON-participants.git`.
Note that because this repo is a fork, your URL will have your github username in it
as follows:

`https://github.com/your-user-name/DI16-NEON-participants`


## View Commits in GitHub

Let’s view our recent commit in our forked GitHub repo.

* From the github.com website, navigate to your forked Institute repo.
* Click on the "commits" link at the top of the page
* Look at the commits - do you see your recent commit message that you typed into bash
on your computer?

Look at your fork of the DI16-NEON-participants, is the markdown file that you 
added and commited in bash there?

* Next, navigate the the master NEON-WorkWithData/DI16-NEON-participants repo from which
 your repo is forked. (The easiest method to do this is to click the link at the
 top of the page under your repo name).
 * Is your new file there? Why not?

Remember the structure of our workflow. You’ve synced your local repository
with your forked version of the Institute repository. But forks are entirely
separate from the master repository they were forked from. Changes to one do not
affect the other unless they are synced. We will learn how to sync these two
repos in the next tutorial *Syncing GitHub Repos with Pull Requests*.

## Summary workflow - Committing Changes

On your computer, within your local copy of the git repository:

* Modify, create, or delete document(s) or repo structure.

On your computer, in shell:

* `git status`
* `git add FileName`
* `git status` - make sure everything is added and ready for commit
* `git commit -m “messageHere”
* `git push origin/gh-pages`

On the GitHub.com website:

* Check to make sure commit is added.
* Check to see if the file is in the file structure or the online repository.
