This tutorial teaches you how create and format markdown files.

<div id="objectives" markdown="1">
# Learning Objectives
At the end of this activity, you will be able to:

* Create a Markdown (.md) file using a text editor.
* Use basic markdown syntax including headers, bold and italics in your document.
* Explain the purpose of a YAML header and the components of the header.

## What is the .md format

Markdown is a text syntax for formatting text documents that are easily human
readable but that can produce a nicely formatted webpage (or other published
document). Markdown is what allows this page that you are reading to have
headers, bold, italics, and other formatting.

We will each create a markdown file that will serve as our introduction to each
other and to share our ideas about the
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/tutorial-series/capstone" target="_blank">Capstone Project</a>
for the Data Institute.

## Markdown formatting

In this section we will briefly review several common Markdown formatting
syntaxes, and then provide you with other references.

Rendered on a website, text will appear as this:

The use of the highlight ( `text` ) is often reserve for denoting code when used
in text. To add emphasis to other text you can use **bold** or *italics*.

In Markdown,this text looks like this:

	 The use of the highlight ( `text` ) will be reserve for denoting code when
	 used in text. To add emphasis to other text use **bold** or *italics*.

Other commonly used syntax includes a

* rule - or line across the page

```sh
	  to create a rule
	  ***
```

***

* headers - there MUST be a space between the # and the text for these to render
properly with Jekyll 3.0.

## Add content
Now that you are a bit familiar with the Markdown syntax, we'll use it to create
a brief biography that introduces yourself to the other participants.

First, create a .md file using the text editor of your preference. Name the file with
your LastName-FirstName.md naming convention. Save it to the XXXX directory in
your local neon-data-institute-2016 repository.

Then in this document you write your brief bio and format it with the markdown
syntax that you've just learned.

In the bio, please provide basic information including:

* name,
* domain of interest,
* one goal for the course

Then add (and revise, if desired) your Capstone Project idea and the
list of data (NEON or other) to support the project, you created during the
first weekâ€™s materials.

**NOTE:** The Data Institute repository is a public repository, so all members of
the institute, as well as anyone in the general public who stumbles on the repo,
can see the information. If you prefer not to share this information publically,
please submit the same document but use a pseudonym (cartoon character names
would work well) and email us with the pseudonym so that we can connect the
submitted document to you.


## What is YAML?

YAML is simply a data format. Or, in their own words from the
<a href="http://www.yaml.org/" target="_blank">YAML website</a>:

> YAML Ain't Markup Language. YAML is a human friendly data serialization
standard for all programming languages.

We will use it as the data or instructions for how and where a webpage should be
displayed. This section of code, at the top of each .md file that becomes a
part of the Data Institute repository, contains the information necessary for the
page to be rendered in GitHub's gh-pages and show up as a webpage.  


### Elements of the YAML for the Institute

For the Institute, you will need to include a YAML element at the top of each
.md or .Rmd (that will be knitted to .md), that is submitted to GitHub. This is

```bash

```

NEED TO SETTLE ON HOW/WHERE CODE WILL BE SUBMITTED, THEN ADD THIS.


Now that you have completed your biography Markdown file, copy the above YAML
element into the top of the document. Make sure to include the `---` a the start
and end as this is how the YAML element is identified. Personalize the

* title,
* description,
* date,
* author (you!),
* and the permalink by adding your last name and first initial -- all lowercase,
no spaces.

Finally, resave the document and proceed to the next tutorial.
