This tutorial teaches you how to add and commit changes to Git version control.

<div id="objectives" markdown="1">
# Learning Objectives
At the end of this activity, you will be able to: 

* Add new files or changes to existing files to your repository. 
* Include messages with your commits to track what is being changed.
* Correctly use `git add` and `git commit` and understand why both are used.
* Sync changes to your local repository with your repository stored on GitHub. 
* Use and interpret the output from the following commands: 
  + `git status`
  + `git add`
  + `git commit`
  + `git push`

Once we’ve changed content in a repository -- our new markdown file with our 
project ideas -- we need to place the content under version control so that we 
can later sync it with our GitHub repos and share it with colleagues.

commit to push GitHub

## Check Status -- git status

Prior to changing anything in a repo always check the status first! This is how 
we see what has occurred in our local repository and what isn’t under version 
control yet! 

Open bash, navigate to the `neon-data-institute-2016` repository on your local 
computer, and check the status using `git bash`

``` bash
# desired directory
$ cd ~/Documents/GitHub/neon-data-repository-2016

# check the status
$ git status

On branch gh-pages
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/gh-pages'.
Changes not staged for commit:
 (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
 (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:  _config.yml

Untracked files:
 (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	_posts/ExampleFile.md

```

Understand the output:

* `On branch gh-pages` - the branch we are working on is always going to be 
gh-pages (see Additional Resources section for more on branches).
* `Changes not staged for commit:` This will be any file that is currently in the 
Git version control system but the **changes** have not yet be added into the 
Git system.
* `Untracked file:` These are all **new files** that have never been added to or 
“watched” by Git. 

## Add Changes - git add

Now we can add the file with our changes using the command `git add FileName.ext`. 

``` bash

# add a file, so that changes are tracked
$ git add ExampleFile.md

# check status again
$ git status

On branch gh-pages
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/gh-pages'.
Changes to be committed:
 (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:  _posts/ExampleFile.md

```

Understand the output: 

*  `Changes to be committed:` These files are ready to be 
committed. 

## Commit Changes - git commit

When we want to permanently add something into Git version control, we have to 
commit it. A single commit will work for all files that are currently added 
(anything in green when we check the status). 
We should add a commit message to describe what is occurring in this commit. 
You will see these commit messages later if reviewing old changes, they let 
you know what happened in each one. Message should be detailed but brief. 
It is often recommended to keep commit messages <50 characters.

``` bash
# commit changes with message
$ git commit -m “new example file for demonstration”

[gh-pages e3cd622] new example file for demonstration
 1 file changed, 56 insertions(+), 4 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 _posts/ExampleFile.md

```

Understand the output: each commit will look slightly different but the 
important parts include: 

*  `gh-pages xxxxxxx` this is the identification of the specific commit. You 
will always be able to track this specific commit through this number. 
* `_ file change, _ insertions(+), _ deletion (-)` this tells you what is 
actually changed. 

Always check it to make sure it is what you expected. If not, you might not 
have committed all the files you wanted to. 

## Why Add, then Commit?

	<figcaption> If you think of Git as taking snapshots of changes over the 
life of a project, git add specifies what will go in a snapshot (putting things
 in the staging area), and git commit then actually takes the snapshot, and
 makes a permanent record of it (as a commit). Image and caption source:

To understand what is going on with `git add` and `git commit` it is important 
to understand that Git has a staging area that we add items to with `git add`. 
Changes are not in version control until we actually commit them. This allows 
us to commit many files at the same time, if we wish. 

## Move from Local Repo to GitHub Repo - git push

After we’ve made all the desired changes, we need to sync our current work with 
that on our forked repo (and eventually, the master repo) on GitHub. To do this
 we need to push our changes from the local git version control to the remote 
GitHub repo. 

We always check the status first, to make sure nothing that we want to commit 
and push to our GitHub repo is being left behind. 

Then we use 
`git push origin/gh-pages`. `origin` specifies that the “push” is going to the 
Git repo that this local version was created from. The `gh-pages` is the branch 
of the repo that you are currently on -- remember we will always be on gh-pages 
for the Institute.

```bash
# always check the status
$ git status

On branch gh-pages
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/gh-pages' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

# transfer committed changes to the forked repo
git push origin/gh-pages

   5022aca..e3cd622  gh-pages -> gh-pages

```

Understand the output: with this output an important part to pay attention to is
which repository the commit was pushed to, here `neon-data-institute-2016`, which
is the one that we want it to go to. 

## Viewing Commits in GitHub

Let’s view our recent commit in our forked GitHub repo. Navigate to your forked 
Institute repo in GitHub. Look at the commits - do you see your recent commit 
message that you typed in bash? 

Now open the XXXX directory, is your new file there?

Navigate the the master NEON-DataSkills/neon-data-institute-2016 repo from which
 your repo is forked. (The easiest method to do this is to click the link at the
 top of the page under your repo name). 

Is your new file there? Why not?

Remember the structure of our workflow. You’ve synced your local repository 
with your forked version of the Institute repository. But forks are entirely 
separate from the master repository they were forked from. Changes to one do not 
affect the other unless they are synced. We will learn how to sync these two 
repos in the next tutorial *Syncing GitHub Repos with Pull Requests*. 

## Summary workflow - Committing Changes

In local repository

* Modify, create, or delete document(s) or repo structure. 

In shell

* `git status`
* `git add FileName` 
* `git status` - make sure everything is added and ready for commit
* `git commit -m “messageHere” 
* `git push origin/gh-pages`

In GitHub

* Check to make sure commit is added.
