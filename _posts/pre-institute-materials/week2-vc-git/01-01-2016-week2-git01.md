Welcome to week two of the NEON Data Institute!

In week two, you will be introduced to the importance of version control in 
scientific workflows and learn how to use Git and the GitHub online hosting 
service as version control tools. 

At the end of week two, you will write an brief biography, revise (if needed) 
your initial research question and required data that you will require to address that question at the 
Institute, and submit this document via GitHub to the Data Institute repository. 

<div id="objectives" markdown="1">
# Learning Objectives
At the end of this activity, you will be able to: 

* Explain what version control is and how it can be used.
* Explain why version control is important. 
* Discuss the basics of how the Git version control system works. 
* Discuss how GitHub can be used as a collaboration tool.

## What is Version Control?

A version control system maintain a record of changes to code and other content. 
It also allows us to revert changes to a previous point in time. 

You’ve probably used some sort of keeping track of versions in the past in the 
past.

There are many forms of version control; 

some not as good,

* Save As with a new date (we’ve all done it, but it isn’t efficient) 
* Google Docs have this as History (not bad for some documents, but limited in scope

some better:

* Mercurial
* Subversion
* Git - which we’ll be learning much more about in this series. 

If interested in other version control options, visit the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_version_control_software" target="_blank">Wikipedia list </a>.

It you want to know about the progression and history of version control, read
the 
<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control" target="_blank"> Git documentation explaining the progression of version control systems</a>.


<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Thought Question:** How do you already implement 
any form of version control in your research? 
{: .notice2}

## Why Version Control is Important

Version control facilitates two important aspects of many scientific workflows:

* The ability to save and review or revert to previous versions. 
* The ability to collaborate on a single project.

This means you don’t have to worry about a collaborator (or future you) 
overwriting something important, nor two people working on the same document and
 then having no way of combining the two improved copies. 

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Thought Questions:** Think of a specific time when 
you weren’t using version control that it would have been useful? Why was 
version control needed? What were the consequences of not having a version 
control system in place? What do you think would have been the result if you’d 
had an efficient version control system in place?

## How a Version Control Systems Works

### Simple Version Control Model

The format varies slightly between software packages but the basic idea is a 
version control system keeps track of what has changed in one or more files 
over time.

Version control systems start with a base version of the document and then save
just the changes you made at each step of the way. You can think of it as a 
tape: if you rewind the tape and start at the base document, then you can play 
back each change and end up with your latest version.

	<figcaption> Changes are saved sequentially.

	</figcaption>
</figure>

Once you think of changes as separate from the document itself, you can then 
think about “playing back” different sets of changes onto the base document 
and getting different versions of the document. For example, two users can make 
independent sets of changes based on the same document.

	<figcaption> Different versions can be saved.

	</figcaption>
</figure>

If there aren’t conflicts -- areas where both people modified a document in
different directions --, you can even play two sets of changes onto the same 
base document.

	</figcaption>
</figure>

A version control system is a tool that keeps track of these changes for us and 
helps us version and merge our files. Each version can be retroactively viewed 
and reverted to. That way if you add something that you end up not liking or 
delete something you need, you can simply go back to a previous version.

### Git & GitHub - A Distributed Version Control Model

</figure>

In a distributed model, like that used by GitHub, we still need to keep track of
any changes to a file or directory structure but this model has several 
advantages:
* a Master version that is always the “current copy” that individual users can 
add changes at different times. This allows for collaboration on the same files. 
* a remote server which allows users in different locations to collaborate. 

### The Forking Workflow using GitHub

There are many different workflows that can be used to work independently or 
collaboratively with Git/GitHub. We will be using a forking workflow where 
there is one master repository and each person owns a copy (or a fork) of the 
master that they work in and update prior to re-syncing with the master 
repository. 

The main components of this workflow that we will be using are:

* **Master repository** - this is the base repository of the project the all 
contributors add to. The master repository is always the master or “live” 
version of a project.  
* User’s **forked repository** - each user has a complete “personal” copy of the 
master repository -- this is called the fork. This is where the user modifies 
content -- it is the “working copy” until they decide to sync with and update 
the master repository. 
* User’s **local repository** - this is a local version of the user’s fork on one’s 
own computer. Editing of content occurs (almost) exclusively here. It is synced 
with the user’s fork. 

This workflow in GitHub allows for it to be an excellent platform for 
collaboration and version control!

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** Other Workflows -- If you chose to 
implement Git/GitHub in your work, know that other workflows are common. 
<a href="<https://ru.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow" target="_blank">This page details some of those workflows that you might want to consider </a>. 
This resource mentions Bitbucket, another web-based hosting service 
like GitHub. We recommend you consider alternate workflows only after 
understanding the one we use in the Institute.
