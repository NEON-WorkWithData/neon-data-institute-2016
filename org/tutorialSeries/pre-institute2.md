## Welcome to Pre-Institute Week 2

This week our goal is to ensure that everyone comes to the Institute ready to
work in a collaborative research environment. If you recall, the four facets
of reproducibility include:

* Documentation
* Organization
* Automation
* Dissemination

This week we will learn git and github. The git environment supports both a
collaborative approach to science through code sharing and dissemination,
and a powerful version control system that supports both efficient project organization,  
and an effective way to save your work.

We hope that you find that the tools and skills you learn in the Institute, will
be as invaluable in your own work!


## Week 2 Activity
