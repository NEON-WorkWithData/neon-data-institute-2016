This tutorial covers how to clone a GitHub repository to your computer so
that you can work locally on files.

<div id="objectives" markdown="1">
# Learning Objectives
At the end of this activity, you will be able to:

* Be able to use the `git clone` command to create a local version of a GitHub
repository on your computer.

## Additional Resources:

* <a href="http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/files/git_cheat_sheet.pdf" target="_blank"> Diagram of Git Commands </a>
-- this diagram includes more commands than we will cover in this series but 
includes all that we use for our standard workflow.

## Create a local repository
In the previous tutorial, we used the GitHub.com interface to fork an existing
repository, creating a copy of it in our GitHub.com account. Now we will learn how to create a
local version of our forked repository, on our laptop so that we can efficiently
add to and edit the repository content.

(local repository) on our computers.


### Copy Repository URL

From the GitHub.com interface:

* Navigate to the repository that you want to clone (copy) to your computer --
this should be `YourUserName/DI16-NEON-participants`.  
* Click on the **Clone or Download** button, and copy the URL of the repository.

From your local computer:

* Your computer should already be setup with Git and a shell interface of choice.
If not, please refer to the
<a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/tutorial-series/pre-institute0/ " target="_blank"> Institute setup materials </a>
before continuing.
* Open bash on your computer and navigate to the GitHub repository that you created
during the Set-up Materials.

To do this, at the command prompt, type:

    $ cd ~/Documents/GitHub

Note: If you have stored your GitHub directory in a location that is different 
- i.e. it is not in /Documents/GitHub, be sure to adjust the above code to 
represent the actual path on your computer.

Now use `git clone` to clone, or create a copy of, the entire repository in the
desired directory on your computer.


    # clone the forked repository to our computers
    $ git clone https://github.com/neon/DI16-NEON-participants.git

The output shows you what is being cloned to your computer.


    Cloning into 'DI16-NEON-participants.git'...
    remote: Counting objects: 3808, done.
    remote: Total 3808 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 3808
    Receiving objects: 100% (3808/3808), 2.92 MiB | 2.17 MiB/s, done.
    Resolving deltas: 100% (2185/2185), done.
    Checking connectivity... done.
    $

Notice that the numbers that you see on your screen, representing the total file
size, etc may differ from the example provided above.

### View the New Repo

Next, let's make sure the repository is created on your
computer in the location where you think it is.

At the command line, type `ls` to list the contents of the current
directory.

    # view directory contents
    $ ls

Next, navigate to the data institute repo using `cd` or change directory:

    # navigate to the NEON participants repository
    $ cd DI16-NEON-participants

    # view repository contents
    $ ls

    404.md			_includes		code
    ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md	_layouts		images
    README.md		_posts			index.md
    _config.yml		_site			institute-materials
    _data			assets			org

Alternatively, we can view the local repo `DI16-NEON-participants` in a finder (Mac)
or Windows Explorer (windows) window. Simply open your Documents in a window and
navigate to the new local repo.

Using either method we can see that the file structure exactly mirrors that we
see in the forked GitHub repo.  


<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Bonus Tip:** You can use Git and connect to GitHub
directly in the RStudio interface. If interested, read

## Summary Workflow -- Create a Local Repo

In the GitHub.com interface:

* Copy URL of the repo you want to work on locally

In Shell:

* `git clone URLhere`

Note: that you can copy the URL of your repository directly from github.
