"Verifiability and reproducibility are among the cornerstones of the scientific 
process. They are what allows scientists to "stand on the shoulder of giants". 
Maintaining reproducibility requires that all data management, analysis, and 
visualization steps behind the results presented in a paper are documented and 
available in full detail. Reproducibility here means that someone else should 
either be able to obtain the same results given all the documented inputs and 
the published instructions for processing them, or if not, the reasons why 
should be apparent."

# Learning Objectives
At the end of this activity, you will be able to : 

* Explain what is meant by Reproducible Science.
* Summarize why reproducible science is important to society, the scientific 
community, and your own research. 
* Explain several ways you can incorporate reproducible science techniques into 
your own research.

As an introduction to Reproducible Science, please view these slides by the 
creators of the Reproducible Science Curriculum. Skip the suggested activity:

How reproducible is your current research? 
Check out this 
<a href="https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/rr-intro/blob/master/checklist.md" target="_blank"> Reproducible Science Checklist </a>
for a list of questions to apply to your own work. 

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Thought Questions:**
Which of these do you already do? 
Which of these do you know enough about right now to incorporate into your research? 
For which of these do you need to gain new skills to be able to incorporate into your research?

##Additional Readings (optional, but interesting)

* Nature has collated/published (with open-access) a special archive on the 
<a href="http://www.nature.com/news/reproducibility-1.17552" target="_blank"> Challenges of Irreproducible Science </a>. 
* The Nature Publishing group has also created a 
<a href="http://www.nature.com/authors/policies/checklist.pdf" target="_blank">Reporting Checklist</a>
for its authors that focuses primaily on reporting issues but also includes 
sections for sharing code.
* Recent open-access issue of 
<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecog.2016.v39.i4/issuetoc" target="_blank">Ecography </a>
 focusing on reproducible ecology and software packages available for use.
