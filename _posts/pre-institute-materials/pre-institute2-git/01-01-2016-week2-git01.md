In this page, you will be introduced to the importance of version control in
scientific workflows.  

<div id="objectives" markdown="1">
# Learning Objectives
At the end of this activity, you will be able to:

* Explain what version control is and how it can be used.
* Explain why version control is important.
* Discuss the basics of how the Git version control system works.
* Discuss how GitHub can be used as a collaboration tool.

</div>

## What is Version Control?

A version control system maintains a record of changes to code and other content.
It also allows us to revert changes to a previous point in time.

point in our lives.

## Types of Version control

There are many forms of version control. Some not as good:

* Save a document with a new date (we’ve all done it, but it isn’t efficient)
* Google Docs "history" function. (not bad for some documents, but limited in scope)

Some better:

* Mercurial
* Subversion
* Git - which we’ll be learning much more about in this series.


<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Thought Question:** Do you currently implement
any form of version control in your work?

## Why Version Control is Important

Version control facilitates two important aspects of many scientific workflows:

1. The ability to save and review or revert to previous versions.
2. The ability to collaborate on a single project.

This means that you don’t have to worry about a collaborator (or your future self)
overwriting something important. It also allows two people working on the same
document a mechanism to efficiently combine ideas and changes.

<div class="notice thought" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Thought Questions:** Think of a specific time when
you weren’t using version control that it would have been useful.

* Why would version control have been helpful to your project / work flow?  
* What were the consequences of not having a version control system in place?

## How Version Control Systems Works

### Simple Version Control Model

A version control system keeps track of what has changed in one or more files
over time. The way this tracking occurs, is slightly different between various
version control tools including `git`, `mercurial` and `svn`. However the
principle is the same.

Version control systems begin with a base version of a document. They then
save just the submitted changes that you make. You can think of version control
as a tape: if you rewind the tape and start at the base document, then you can
play back each change and end up with your latest version.

	</figcaption>
</figure>

Once you think of changes as separate from the document itself, you can then
think about “playing back” different sets of changes onto the base document.
You can then retrieve, or revert to different versions of the document.

The benefit of version control when you are in a collaborative environment, is that
two users can make independent changes to the same document.

	</figcaption>
</figure>

If there aren’t conflicts between the users changes (a conflict is an areas
where both users modified the same part of the same document, in in different
ways) you can even review two sets of changes on the same base document.

 <figure>
	<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/pre-institute-content/pre-institute2-git/SWC_Git_merge.svg">
	<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/pre-institute-content/pre-institute2-git/SWC_Git_merge.svg"></a>
	<figcaption>Two sets of changes to the same base document, can be reviewed
  together, within a version control system IF there are no conflicts (areas
    where both users modified the SAME PART of the same document in different ways
    ). Changes submitted by both users can then be merged together.

	</figcaption>
</figure>

A version control system is a tool that keeps track of these changes for us.
Each version of a file can be viewed and reverted to at any time. That way if you
add something that you end up not liking or delete something that you need, you
can simply go back to a previous version.



### Git & GitHub - A Distributed Version Control Model

GitHub use a distributed version control model. This means that there can be
many copies (or forks in git world) of the repository.

<figure>
 <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/book/01-introduction/images/distributed.png">
 <img src="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/book/01-introduction/images/distributed.png"></a>
 <figcaption>One advantage of a distributed version control system is that there
 are many copies of the repository. Thus, if any server or computer dies, any of
  the client repositories can be copied and used to restore the data! Every clone
  (or fork) is a full backup of all the data.

 </figcaption>
</figure>

Have a look at the graphic below. Notice that in the example, there is a "main"
version of our repository. Joe, Sue and Even are all working together to update
the main repository. Because they are using a distributed system, each user (Joe,
  Sue and Eve) has a full working copy of the repository.

### Create A Working Copy of a Git Repo - Fork

There are many different Git/GitHub workflows. In the NEON Data Institute, we
will take advantage of the distributed workflow that git allows where many people
can be work independently, on the same repository. Our collaborative workflow goes
like this:

* NEON "owns" the <a hreaf="https://github.com/NEON-WorkWithData/DI16-NEON-participants" target="_blank">main repository.</a>
* You will create a copy of this repository (known as a FORK) in your own GitHub account.
* You will then `clone` the repository (copy the repo to your local computer). You
will do your work, locally, on your laptop.
* When you are ready to submit your changes to the NEON repository, you will:
   * Sync (copy all changes) your local copy of the institute repo with NEON's repository.
   * Push the changes you made to your copy or FORK of the repository -  
   to NEON's main repository.

Each participant in the institute will be contributing to the NEON main repository,
using the same workflow!

	<figcaption>The NEON MAIN Repo is the final working version of our project. You
  can **fork** or create a copy of this repo into your github.com account. You
  can then copy or **CLONE** your fork, to your local computer where you can make
  edits. When you are done working, you can push or transfer those edits back
  to your local fork. When you are read to update the NEON MAIN repo, you submit
  a pull request. We will be walking through the steps of this workflow over the
  next few lessons.

Let's get some terms straight before we go any further.

* **Main repository** - The main repository is what all participants will
add to. It is the "final working version" of the project.
* **Your forked repository** - is a "personal” working copy of the
main repository stored in your local GitHub account. This is called the fork.
When you are happy with your work, you can sync your repo with the main repo.
Finally, you can update main NEON repository.
* **Your local repository** - this is a local version of your fork on your
own computer. You will most often do all of your work locally, on your computer.
