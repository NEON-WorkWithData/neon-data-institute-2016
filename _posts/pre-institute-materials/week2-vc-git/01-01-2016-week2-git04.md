<div id="objectives" markdown="1">
# Learning Objectives
At the end of this activity, you will be able to:

</div>

## What is the .md format
Create a .md file using text editor
Save it to the XXXX  directory in your local neon-data-institute-2016 repository.
Name it with a XXXX naming convention.  

## Add content
This Markdown file will be used to introduce yourself and you Capstone project 
idea to the other in the Institute.  

Write a biography that introduces yourself to the other participants. Please 
provide basic information including:

* name,
* domain of interest, 
* one goal for the course

Then add (and revise, if desired) your Capstone Project idea and the list of 
data (NEON or other) to support the project, you created during last weekâ€™s 
materials.  

**NOTE:** The Data Institute repository is a public repository, so all members of 
the institute, as well as anyone in the general public who stumbles on the repo, 
can see the information.  If you prefer not to share this information publically, 
please submit the same document but use a pseudonym (cartoon character names 
would work well) and email us with the pseudonym so that we can connect the 
submitted document to you.  

## Markdown formatting
