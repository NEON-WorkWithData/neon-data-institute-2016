## Welcome to pre-Institute Week 1

In the first week of the pre-institute activities, we will review the NEON 
project.
We will also provide you with a general overview of reproducible science. 

## Week 1 Activity
The materials below will walk you through the activity. In brief, write up a 
summary of a project that you might be interested in and what data (NEON or 
other) would be needed to address this question. You will have time over the 
next few weeks to refine your idea, the goal here is to get you to start 
thinking of feasible ideas. Save this document as you will use it again next 
week. 

Please complete by 11:59 Thursday June 2nd. 

## Week 1 Materials
Please read (and watch) the materials in the two posts below.
