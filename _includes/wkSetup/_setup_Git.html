Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes to what 
when and has options for easily updating a shared or public version of your code
on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" >github.com</a>. You will need a 
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/" target="_blank">supported</a>
web browser (current versions of Chrome, Firefox or Safari, or Internet Explorer
version 9 or above).

<strong>For OS X 10.9 and higher</strong>, install Git for Mac
by downloading and running the most recent "mavericks" installer from
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/"  target="_blank">this list</a>.
After installing Git, there will not be anything in your 
<code>/Applications</code> folder, as Git is a command line program.
<strong>For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.8)</strong> use the
most recent available installer labelled "snow-leopard"
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/"  target="_blank">available here</a>.

If Git is not already available on your machine you can try to
install it via your distro's package manager. For Debian/Ubuntu run
<code>sudo apt-get install git</code> and for Fedora run
<code>sudo yum install git</code>.
