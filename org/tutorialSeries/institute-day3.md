## About

We will begin the day with several short talks on the signficance of 
uncertainty when using remote sensing data. We will then complete a short 
exercise where we learn how to compare remote sensing metrics to metrics
collected on the ground (in situ metrics). 

The afternoon will be spent working on a mini-group project that is focused 
on uncertainty.
