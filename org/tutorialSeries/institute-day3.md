## About

Today, we will focus on the importance of uncertainty when using remote sensing
data. We will work on a hands-on activity where we compare remote sensing
derived vegetation metrics to metrics collected on the ground (in situ).

# Learning Objectives

After completing these activities, you will be able to:

* Measure the differences between a metric derived from remote sensing data and 
the same metric derived from data collected on the ground.
