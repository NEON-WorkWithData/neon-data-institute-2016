{% include _toc.html %}

In this tutorial we will fork, or create a copy of in your github.com account,
an existing GitHub repository. We will also explore the GitHub.com interface.

<div id="objectives" markdown="1">
# Learning Objectives
At the end of this activity, you will be able to:

* Create a GitHub account.
* Know how to navigate to and between GitHub repositories.
* Create your own fork, or copy, a GitHub repository.
* Explain the relationship between your forked repository and the master
repository it was created from.

## Additional Resources:

* <a href="http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/files/git_cheat_sheet.pdf" target="_blank"> Diagram of Git Commands </a>
-- this diagram includes more commands than we will
learn in this series but includes all that we use for our standard workflow.
* <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/" target="_blank"> GitHub Help Learning Git resources </a>

</div>

## Create an account.
If you do not already have a GitHub account, go to <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank" >GitHub </a> and sign up for
your free account. Pick a username that you like! This username is what your
colleagues will see as you work with them on git.

Take a minute to setup your account. Be sure to add a profile picture to
your account!

If you already have a GitHub account, simply sign in.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** Are you a student? Sign up for the
<a href="https://education.github.com/pack" target="_blank" >Student Developer Pack</a>
and get the Git Personal account free (with unlimited private repos and other
discounts/options; normally $7/month).

## Navigate GitHub

### Repositories

Let's first discuss the repository or "Repo". (The cool kids say repo, so we will
  jump on the git cool kid bandwagon) and use "repo" from here on in. According to
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/" target="_blank"> the GitHub glossary</a>
, a repository (repo) is:

> A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine
as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including
documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have
multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.

In the Data Institute, we will share our work on the
<a href="https://github.com/NEON-WorkWithData/DI16-NEON-participants" target="_blank">DI16-NEON-participants repository.</a>

### Find an Existing Repository

The first thing that you'll need to do is find the DI16-participants repo.
You can find repos in two ways:

1. Type  “**DI16-NEON-participants**”  in the github.com search bar to find the repository.
2. Use the repository URL if you have it - like so:
<a href="https://github.com/NEON-WorkWithData/DI16-NEON-participants"  target="_blank"> https://github.com/NEON-WorkWithData/DI16-NEON-participants</a>.

### Navigation of a Repo Page

Once you have found the Data Institute participants repository, take 5 minutes
to explore it.


#### GitHub Repository Names
First get to know the repository naming convention. Repository names all take
the format: **OrganizationName**/**RepositoryName**. So the full name of our
repository is **NEON-WorkWithData/DI16-NEON-participants**

#### Header Tabs

  repo name including: Code, Issues, Pull Request, Pulse, Graphics and Settings.
  NOTE: Because you are not an administrator for this repo, you will not see the   "Settings" tab in your browser.

</figure>

At the top of the page you'll also notice a series of tabs. Please focus
on the following 3 for now:

* **Code:** Click here to view structure & contents of the repo.
* **Issues:** Submit discussion topics, or problems that you are having with
the content in the repo, here.
* **Pull Requests:** Submit changes to the repo for review /
acceptance. We will explore pull requests more in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/tutorial-series/pre-institute2/git05" target="_blank">
Git 06 tutorial.</a>

#### Other Text Links

A bit further down the page, you'll notice a few other "tabs":

* **commits** - a commit is a saved and documented change to the content
or structure of the repo. The commit history contains all changes that
have been made to that repo. We will discuss commits more in
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/tutorial-series/pre-institute2/git05" target="_blank"> Git 05 Git Add Changes -- Commits </a>.

## Fork a Repository

Next, let's discuss the concept of a fork on the Github.com site. A fork is a
copy of the repo that you create in **your account**. You can fork any repo at
any time by clicking the fork button in the upper right hand corner on github.com.

 <figcaption>When we fork a repo in github.com we are telling git to create an
 exact copy of the repo that we're forking, in our own, github.com account.
 Once the repo is in our own account, we can edit it as we now own that fork or
 copy of the repo! Note that a fork is just a copy of the repo on github.com.
 If you want to efficiently edit / work on the files, you will likely want to
 copy the repo locally - or CLONE it to your local computer.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** You can change the name of the forked
repository name at this point. For now, but for now leave it the same!

## Check Out Your Data Institute Fork

If you are not already there, return to your github account page. Check out your
new fork. Its name should be: **YOUR-USER-NAME/DI16-NEON-participants**.

It can get confusing sometimes moving between a MAIN repo:

* https://github.com/NEON-WorkWithData/DI16-NEON-participants

and your forked repo:

* https://github.com/YOUR-USER-NAME/DI16-NEON-participants

A good way to figure out which repo you are viewing is to look at the name of the
repo. Does it contain your username? Or your colleagues? Or NEONs?

## Your Fork vs the MAIN Repository

At this point, you could compare your fork to the NEON MAIN repository using
the **pull request** option. We will learn about pull requests in
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/tutorial-series/pre-institute2/git06" target="_blank"> Git06: Sync GitHub Repos with Pull Requests.</a>
For now, take our word for it. The fork is *an exact copy* or completely in sync
with the NEON MAIN repo.

The fork will remain in sync with the NEON MAIN repo until:

1. We begin to make changes to our forked copy of the repo.
2. The master repository is changed or updated by a collaborator.

If you make changes to your forked repo the changes will
not be added to the NEON MAIN repo until you sync your fork with the NEON MAIN
repo.

## Summary Workflow -- Fork a GitHub Repository

On the GitHub.com website:

* Navigate to desired repo that you want to fork.
* Click Fork button.
