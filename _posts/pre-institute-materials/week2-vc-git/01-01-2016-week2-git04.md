This tutorial covers how create and format markdown files.

<div id="objectives" markdown="1">
# Learning Objectives
At the end of this activity, you will be able to:

* Use basic markdown syntax to format a document including: headers, bold and italics.

</div>

## What is the .md format?

Markdown is a syntax for formatting text documents that are easily human
readable. Markdown can be used to produce nicely formatted documents including
pdf's, web pages and more. In fact, this web page that you are reading right now
is generated from a markdown document!

In this tutorial, we will create a markdown file that documents both who you are
and also the project that you might want to work on at the 2016 Data Institute.

## Markdown formatting

Markdown is simple plain text, that is styled using simply symbols including:

` #, **,  *  '' `

Let's review some basic markdown syntax.  

### Plain text

Plain text will appear as text in a markdown document. You can format that
text in different ways.

For example, if we want to highlight a function or some code within a plain text paragraph,
we can use "`  `". Like this: `Here is some code`. This is the backtick, or 
grave; not an apostrophe.  

To add emphasis to other text you can use **bold** or *italics*.

Have a look at the markdown below:

	 The use of the highlight ( `text` ) will be reserve for denoting code when
	 used in text. To add emphasis to other text use **bold** or *italics*.

Notice that this sentence uses both a code highlight "``", bold and italics.
As a rendered markdown chunk, it looks like this:

The use of the highlight ( `text` ) will be reserve for denoting code when
used in text. To add emphasis to other text use **bold** or *italics*.

### Horizontal lines (rules)

Create a rule:

	  # to create a rule
	  ***

Below is the rule rendered:

## Section Headings

You can create a heading using the pound (#) sign. Heading one is one pound sign,
heading two is 2 pound signs, etc as follows:

## Heading two
	## Heading two

### Heading three
	### Heading three

#### Heading four
	#### Heading four

## Activity: Create A Markdown Document

Now that you are familiar with the Markdown syntax, you can use it it to create
a brief biography that

1. Introduces yourself to the other participants.
2. Documents the project that you have in mind for the Data Institute.

### Add Your Bio
First, create a .md file using the text editor of your preference. Name the 
file with your LastName-FirstName.md naming convention. Save it to the 
**participants/bios-week2** directory in your local DI16-NEON-participants 
repository.

Add a brief bio using headers, bold and italic formatting as makes sense.
In the bio, please provide basic information including:

* Your Name
* Domain of interest
* One goal for the course


### Add a Capstone Project Description

Next, add a revised Capstone Project idea to the markdown document. Be sure
to specify in the document the types of data that you think you may require to
complete your project.

</div>

**NOTE:** The Data Institute repository is a public repository visible to anyone
with internet access. If you prefer to not share your bio information publically,
please submit your markdown document using a pseudonym for your name. You may also
want to use a pseudonym for your  git account. HINT: cartoon character names work well.
Please email us with the pseudonym so that we can connect the submitted document to you.
