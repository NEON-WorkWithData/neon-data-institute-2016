In this tutorial we will fork, or create a copy of, an existing GitHub
repository. We will also explore the GitHub interface.

<div id="objectives" markdown="1">
# Learning Objectives
At the end of this activity, you will be able to:

* Create a GitHub account.
* Know how to navigate to and between GitHub repositories.
* Create your own fork, or copy, a GitHub repository.
* Explain the relationship between your forked repository and the master
repository it was created from.

## Additional Resources:

* <a href="http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/files/git_cheat_sheet.pdf" target="_blank"> Diagram of Git Commands </a>
-- this diagram includes more commands than we will
learn in this series but includes all that we use for our standard workflow.
* <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/" target="_blank"> GitHub Help Learning Git resources </a>

</div>

## Create an account.
If you do not already have a GitHub account, go to <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank" >GitHub </a> and sign up for
your free account. Pick a username that you like! This is what your colleagues will
see as you work with them on git.

If you already have a GitHub account, simply sign in.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** Are you a student? Sign up for the
<a href="https://education.github.com/pack" target="_blank" >Student Developer Pack</a>
and get the Git Personal account free (with unlimited private repos and other
discounts/options; normally $7/month).

## Navigate GitHub

### Repositories

The first thing that we need to explain it the repository.
According to
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/" target="_blank"> the GitHub glossary</a>
, a repository is:

> A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine
as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including
documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have
multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.

In the Data Institute, we will share our work on the
**DI16-NEON-participants** repository.

### Find an Existing Repository

The first thing that you'll need to do is find the DI16-participants repository.
You can find repositories in two ways:

1. Type  “**DI16-NEON-participants**”  in the search bar to find the repository.
2. You can use the repository URL if you have it - like so:
<a href="https://github.com/NEON-WorkWithData/DI16-NEON-participants target="_blank"> https://github.com/NEON-WorkWithData/DI16-NEON-participants</a>.

### Navigation of a Repo Page

Once you have found the Data Institute participants repository, take 5 minutes 
to explore it.


#### GitHub Repository Names
First get to know the repository naming convention. Repository names all take
the format: **OrganizationName**/**RepositoryName**. So the full name of our
repository is **NEON-WorkWithData/DI16-NEON-participants**

#### Header Tabs

	</figcaption>
</figure>

At the top of the page you'll also notice a series of tabs:

* **Code:** Here you see the structure & contents of the entire repository.
* **Issues:** Issues are areas to discuss the contents of the repo.
* **Pull Requests:** Pull requests are how where you can see the changes that
external collaborators (like yourself) have submitted to the site for review /
acceptance. We will explore pull requests more in the Git 06 tutorial.
* and others. 

#### Other Text Links

* **commits** - a commit represents a saved and documented change to the content
or structure of the repository. The commit history contains all changes that
have been made to that repo. We will discuss commits more in
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/tutorial-series/pre-institute2/git05" target="_blank"> Git 05 *Git Add Changes -- Commits* </a>.

## Fork a Repository

GRAPHIC: GitHub Workflow Basic- Fork portion only
Caption: Now we are we are going to fork, or copy, a master repository to create
a user’s forked repository.

You can fork any repo by clicking on the fork button.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** You can change the name of the forked 
repository name at this point. For now, but for now leave it the same!
{: .notice}

## Check Out Your Data Institute Fork

If you are not already there, return to your github account page. Check out your
new fork. It's name should be: **YourUserID/DI16-NEON-participants**.

The name of the fork is a good place to  look if you even are unsure as to
which repo you are in - in the GitHub interface.

## Your Fork vs the Master Repository

At this point, you could compare your fork to the NEON master repository using 
the **pull request** option. We will learn about pull requests in 
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/tutorial-series/pre-institute2/git06" target="_blank"> *Git06: Sync GitHub Repos with Pull Requests*</a>
For now, take our word for it. The fork is *an exact copy* or completely in sync
with the master repo.

The fork will remain in sync with the master repository until:

1. We begin to make changes to our forked copy of the repository.
2. The master repository is changed or updated by a collaborator.

In the same way, if you make changes to your forked repository the changes will
not be added to the master repo until you sync the two.

## Summary Workflow -- Fork a GitHub Repository

In GitHub

* Navigate to desired repo that you want to fork
* Click Fork button
* If desired, rename fork.
