# About
Today, we will review the basics of discrete return and full waveform lidar data.
We will then work with some NEON lidar derived raster data products in R.

In the afternoon we will focus on automation as a means to write more efficient,
usable code.

# Learning Objectives

After completing these activities, you will be able to:

* Explain the difference between active and passive sensors.
* Explain the difference between discrete return and full waveform LiDAR.
* Describe applications of LiDAR remote sensing data in the natural sciences. 
* Describe several NEON LiDAR remote sensing data products.
* Explain why modularization is important and supports efficient coding practices.
* How to modularize code using functions.
* Integrate basic automation into your existing data workflow.

The LiDAR and imagery data used to create this raster teaching data subset were 
collected over the 
<a href="http://www.neonscience.org/" target="_blank">National Ecological Observatory Networkâ€™s </a>
<a href="http://www.neonscience.org/science-design/field-sites/lower-teakettle" target="_blank">Lower Teakettle field site </a>
and processed at NEON 
headquarters. The entire dataset can be accessed by request from the 
<a href="http://www.neonscience.org/data-resources/get-data/airborne-data" target="_blank"> NEON Airborne Data Request Page on the NEON website.
