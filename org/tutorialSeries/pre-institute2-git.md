## Welcome to Pre-Institute Week 2

The goal of the pre-institute materials is to ensure that everyone comes to the
Institute ready to work in a collaborative research environment. If you recall,
the four facets of reproducibility include:

* Documentation
* Organization
* Automation
* Dissemination

This week we will focus on Git and GitHub. The Git environment supports both a
collaborative approach to science through code sharing and dissemination,
and a powerful version control system that supports both efficient project
organization, and an effective way to save your work.

We hope that you find that the tools and skills you learn during this Institute will
be invaluable in your own work!


## Week 2 Assignment

The assignment for this week is to revise the Data Institute capstone project
summary that you developed last week. You will submit your project summary, with
a brief biography to introduce yourself, to a shared <a href="https://github.com/NEON-WorkWithData/DI16-NEON-participants" target="_blank">GitHub repository - https://github.com/NEON-WorkWithData/DI16-NEON-participants</a>. See
the Pre-Institute Week 2 Activity (link below) for full details. If you are
familiar with the forking workflow on GitHub and use of Git in the command line,
you may be able to complete the assignment without completing all the tutorials.

Please complete this assignment by 11:59 Thursday June 9th.
