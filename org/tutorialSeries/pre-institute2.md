## Welcome to Pre-Institute Week 2

The goal of the pre-institute materials is to ensure that everyone comes to the
Institute ready to
work in a collaborative research environment. If you recall, the four facets
of reproducibility include:

* Documentation
* Organization
* Automation
* Dissemination

This week we will focus on git and github. The git environment supports both a
collaborative approach to science through code sharing and dissemination,
and a powerful version control system that supports both efficient project organization,  
and an effective way to save your work.

We hope that you find that the tools and skills you learn in the Institute, will
be as invaluable in your own work!


## Week 2 Activity

The assignment for this week is to revise
the Data Institute project summary that you developed last week. Submit your project
summary to a shared GitHub.com repository.
