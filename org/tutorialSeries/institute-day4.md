## About

On Thursday, we will begin to think about the different types of analysis
that we can do by fusing LiDAR and hyperspectral data products.

<div id="objectives" markdown="1">

# Learning Objectives

After completing these activities, you will be able to:

* Describe a thresholding approach to data fusion that masks and identifies 
areas of a site with similar physical and other characteristics 
(e.g. the same slope, aspect, elevation, vegetation height)
* Describe a statistical approach to data fusion

The LiDAR and imagery data used to create this raster teaching data subset were 
collected over the 
<a href="http://www.neonscience.org/" target="_blank">National Ecological Observatory Networkâ€™s </a>
<a href="http://www.neonscience.org/science-design/field-sites/lower-teakettle" target="_blank">Lower Teakettle field site </a>
and processed at NEON 
headquarters. The entire dataset can be accessed by request from the 
<a href="http://www.neonscience.org/data-resources/get-data/airborne-data" target="_blank"> NEON Airborne Data Request Page on the NEON website.
