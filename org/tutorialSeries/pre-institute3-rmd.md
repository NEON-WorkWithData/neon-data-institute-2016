## Welcome to pre-Institute Week 3

The goal of the pre-institute materials is to ensure that everyone comes to the
Institute better prepared to work in a collaborative research environment, using
reproducible approaches and tools. In week 3, we will cover cover use of the
R Markdown file format to document code and efficiently publish code results /
outputs. You will practice your git skills by publishing your work in the **NEON-WorkWithData/DI16-NEON-participants** GitHub repository.

Please complete the activity and submit your work to the GitHub repo by
**11:59 Thursday June 16th.**
