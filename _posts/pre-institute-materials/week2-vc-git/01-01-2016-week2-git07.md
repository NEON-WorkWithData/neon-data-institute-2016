This tutorial teaches you how to clone a GitHub repository to your computer so
that you can work locally on files.

<div id="objectives" markdown="1">
# Learning Objectives
At the end of this activity, you will be able to: 

* Explain why it is important to update a local repo before beginning edits. 
* Update your local repository from your fork on GitHub. 

## Additional Resources:

-- this diagram includes more commands than we will 
learn in this series but includes all that we use for our standard workflow.

## Update Local Repo
Prior to starting a new round of edits in your local repository, you always want
to update it with any changes from collaborators. This allows you to always be
working on the most updated version, to see any colleagues edits, and prevents
conflicts where two people edit the same thing but with different results. Git 
can’t decipher the order of the “snapshots” these edits represent and you are 
prevented from merging the documents -- this is a merge conflict.

	<figcaption>  Merge conflicts occur when the same part of a script or 
document has been changed simultaneously and Git can’t determine should be 
applied. NOTE- I'm modifying the SWC .svg files to fit this example. This is here
as a place holder for the concept to be presented.

To avoid this you should always update your fork from the master Institute 
repository (see the previous tutorial
<a href="{{ site.basurl }}/tutorial-series/pre-institute2/git06 " target="_blank"> *Syncing GitHub Repos with Pull Requests*</a>)
and then update your local repository from the fork, before starting any edits. 

Using bash we update, we simply use `git pull` once we are in the desired 
repository. 

```bash
# navigate to desired directory
cd ~/Documents/GitHub/neon-data-institute-2016

# update local repo
git pull

remote: Counting objects: 25, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (15/15), done.
remote: Total 25 (delta 16), reused 19 (delta 10), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (25/25), done.

```
Understand the output:
The output will change with every update, several things to look for in the output:

* `remote: …`: tells you how many items have changed. 
* `From URL`: which remote repository is data being pulled from.  For the 
Institute, it should always be your fork of the Institute repo. 
* Section with + and - : this visually shows you which documents are updated 
and the types of edits (additions/deletions) that were made. 

## Summary Workflow -- Update Local Repo
In Bash

* `git pull`
