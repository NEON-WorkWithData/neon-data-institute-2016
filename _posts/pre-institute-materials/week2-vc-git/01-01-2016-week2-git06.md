This tutorial covers how to sync files between your local copy of a git repo,
your forked github.com version of the repo and a master repo.

<div id="objectives" markdown="1">
# Learning Objectives
At the end of this activity, you will be able to:

* Explain the concept of base fork and head fork.
* Know how to transfer changes (sync) between repos in GitHub.
* Create a Pull Request on the GitHub.com website.


## Additional Resources:

* <a href="http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/files/git_cheat_sheet.pdf" target="_blank"> Diagram of Git Commands </a>
-- this diagram includes more commands than we will
learn in this series but includes all that we use for our standard workflow.

We now have done the following:

1. we've forked a copy of the NEON github repo to our github.com account.
2. we've CLONED that repo - making a copy of it on our local, computers
3. We've added files and content to the repo and COMMITTED those changes.
4. We've PUSHED those changes back up to the forked git repo on github.com

In this tutorial, we will learn how to transfer these changes from our forked
copy of the repo in our github.com account to the MASTER NEON repository. The
transfer of information between
two repositories in GitHub is done using a Pull Request.

Notice in the screen shot above that there is a a line that says:

`This branch is 1 commit ahead, 2 commits behind InstituteRepo:gh-pages`.

This message tells us that this particular fork, which is located in `mjones01/`
account, is BEHIND the master institute repository.

**What this means:** If a fork is BEHIND another repository, it means that someone
has made changes to the other repository that you do not have in your fork. The
two repositories are **out of sync**.


This message allows you to see the status of your current fork relative to the repo it was
forked from. Prior to pushing the changes that you made in your fork of the master
repository, it is important to ensure that your fork is synced (it has the most 
  recent changes from the master repository).

We can use a pull request to sync the two repositories.

## Pull Requests in GitHub

### Update Your Fork

*This section, with modifications, is borrowed from
<a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#pr" target="_blank"> the GitHub Hello World guide</a>.
They provide an animated version of these directions.*

To avoid problems with merging changes later, you want to update your fork from
the master repository. Do this by creating a new pull request. Pull Requests are
the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you’re
proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your
contribution and merge them into their project.

Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both repositories.
The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.


#### Step 1 - Start Pull Request
Click the Pull Request tab, then from the Pull Request page, click the green
New pull request button.

#### Step 2 - Choose Repos to Update
Select your fork to compare with master repo. Here we want to add any changes
in the master repo to your fork. You must select the correct head and base to
ensure that the changes are being added to the correct repo.

**Head vs base**

* Base - repository that will be updated, the changes will be added to this repo.
* Head - repository from which the changes come.

One way to remember this is that the “head” is always a*head* of the base, so
we must add from the head to the base.

The head and base will automatically populate with your fork as the base and the
repository from which you forked it as the base. This is great for when you want
to update FROM our master Institute repository but backward of what we want when
we want to update our forks.

To switch the head and base, you need to change one of them and then click
“compare across forks” to be able to select the other one.

#### Step 3 - Verify Changes
Look over your changes in the diffs on the Compare page, make sure they’re what
you want to submit.

#### Step 4 - Create Pull Request
When you’re satisfied that these are the changes you want to submit, click the
big green Create Pull Request button.

#### Step 5 - Title Pull Request
Give your pull request a title and write a brief description of your changes.
When you’re done with your message, click Create pull request!

Check out the repo name up at the top, when creating the Pull Request you will
be automatically transferred to the base repo. Since your fork was the base
(we are updating it), we are still there.

#### Step 6 - Merge Pull Request
In this final step, it’s time to bring your changes together – merging any
changes the master repo with your forked repo.

If you have permissions in the repo, which you do since this is your repo, click
the green Merge Pull Request button to merge the changes into the master repo.
Then click Confirm Merge.

We now have made sure that our forked repository is synced with any changes
that might have occurred in the master Institute repo since we created (or
last synced) it. Now we need to add our committed changes to the Institute repo.

### Update from Your Fork
Now we need to repeat the steps, but change the base and head so that the
transfer of data occurs in the other direction - from our fork to the master
Institute repository.

Repeat the steps above, with the base and head switched.

When you get to the step of Merge Pull Request, what happens?
You can only merge if you have permissions in the base repo that you are adding
to, at this point you don’t have contributor permissions. Instead someone who is
 a contributor on the repository will need to review and accept the request.
