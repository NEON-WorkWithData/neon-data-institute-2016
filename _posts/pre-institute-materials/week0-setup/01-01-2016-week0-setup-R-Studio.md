## R and RStudio

Once R and RStudio are installed (installation instruction above), open RStudio 
to make sure it works and you donâ€™t get any error messages. Then install the 
needed R packages. 

## Install/Update R Packages

Please make sure all of these packages are installed and up to date on your 
computer prior to the Institute.

* `install.packages(c("raster", "rastervis", "rhdf5", "rgdal", "rgeos", "rmarkdown", "knitr", "rastervis"))`
