In this tutorial, we will cover the R `knitr` package that is used to convert
R Markdown into a rendered document (html, pdf, etc).

<div id="objectives" markdown="1">

# Learning Objectives

At the end of this activity, you will:

* Be able to produce (‘knit’) an html file from a R Markdown script.
* Know how to modify chuck options to change the output in your html file.

</div>

## Share & Publish Results Directly from Your Code!
The knitr package allow us to:

* easily publish & share preliminary results with collaborators.
* create professional reports directly from the code with no middle step with
chance for accidental copy and paste / transcription errors
* document our workflow in a fully reproducible way
* to easily change reports and figures following small changes to data, figures,
analysis, etc.

## Publish from Rmd files with knitr
Prior to starting this tutorial you need to make sure the knitr package is
installed, if not, go to
<a href="http://neon-workwithdata.github.io/neon-data-institute-2016/tutorial-series/pre-institute0/" target="_blank"> the setup instructions</a>.
In addition you need a R Markdown script that is to be knit, if you don’t have
one, return to
<a href="http://neon-workwithdata.github.io/neon-data-institute-2016/tutorial-series/pre-institute3/rmd03" target="_blank"> the R Markdown tutorial</a>
to create one.

### When to Knit?

Using an R Markdown script, you can still view all results and figures in R /
RStudio anytime you run the script. You should knit anytime you want to see how
the document looks as a "published" report. The time required to knit depends on
the length and complexity of the script and the amount of data.

### How to Knit

</figure>

To knit, you simply click the "knit" button at the top of the script environment.

A new windowpane will open in your Console titled R Markdown. This pane shows
the progress of knitting occurring -- you can see each chunk knit and the names
of the output file. The output file will automatically be saved in the current
working directory. If there is an error in the code, this is also where the
error message will occur with a line number to help you diagnose the problem.


<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip** If you want to automate knitting into
your script, you can add `render(“input.Rmd”, “all”)` to the script.

## Activity: Knit Script
Knit the script you started in
<a href="http://neon-workwithdata.github.io/neon-data-institute-2016/tutorial-series/pre-institute3/rmd03" target="_blank">the last tutorial</a>.
What does it look like?
</div>

### View the Output

EMBED GRAPHIC: Screenshot of html

Once the document knits, the new html file will automatically open.

Notice that information from the YAML header (title, author, date) are printed
at the top of the document. Then the html shows the text, code, and results of
your script.

 <div id="challenge" markdown="1">
## Activity: Knit with Chunk Options
Go in and change one or more of the chunk code options. Re-knit. Did this change
the output the way you expected?

Complete this week’s assignment by XXX (add detailed once this is set).

Once done, re-knit the document. Check the text and code styling, should
anything be changed or added to make the results more clear? Change and re-knit
until you are satisfied with your document.

Once satisfied, publish your output in our GitHub repository --- push the .html
to the **/participants/TEAKRmd-week3/** directory in the
**NEON-WorkWithData/DI16-NEON-participants** GitHub repository.
