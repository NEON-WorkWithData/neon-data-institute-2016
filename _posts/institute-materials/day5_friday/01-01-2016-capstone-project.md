## About

The goals of the 2016 NEON data institute are to:

1. Provide hands-on experience with and knowledge needed to work with NEON remote
sensing data. and,
2. Provide an overview to efficient, reproducible science workflows.

On this final day of work, you will break up into small groups, to work on addressing
a science question using NEON and other data.

NEON remote sensing data are available on the hard drives that you were provided with!

## Getting started

1. Figure out your group. <<- (google doc where they will post what they want to work on)
2. Figure out what data you will need and how much time you will need / have.
3. Run your idea past one of the Data Institute faculty (Kyla, Naupaka, Leah, Tristan, Dave, etc)
4. Get to work

## Document Your Work

As you work on this project, please be sure to think about efficient workflows.
This includes:

* Organize your project data, code and outputs.
* Write your code in RMD so you can clearly document the steps.


## Presentations

You will present your project to the group on Saturday, 25 June 2016.
You might consider creating a presentation using RMD <<link to the lesson on how to do this>>.
