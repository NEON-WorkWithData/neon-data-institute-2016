This repository supports NEON's 2016 Data Institute. 

NEON's Data Institute provides critical skills and foundational 
knowledge for graduate students and early career scientists working with 
heterogeneous spatio-temporal data to address ecological questions. Our 2016 
Institute will focus on remote sensing of vegetation using open source tools to
promote reproducible science.
