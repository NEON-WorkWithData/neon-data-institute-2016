## Create a new RMarkdown file in RStudio

Our goal in week 3 is to document our workflow. We can do this by 

1. Creating an RMD file in R studio and
2. Rendering that RMD file to HTML using `knitr`. 

Watch this 6:38 minute video below to learn more about how you can convert an R Markdown
file to html (or other formats) using `knitr` in R Studio. 
The text size in the video is small so you may want to watch the video in
full screen mode.

## Create an RMD File

Now that you have a sense of how RMarkdown can be used in R studio, you are 
ready to create your own RMD document. Do the following: 

1. Create a new R Markdown file and choose HTML as the desired output format.
2. Enter a Title (Explore NEON LiDAR Data) and Author Name (your name). Then click OK.
3. Save the file using the following format: **LastName-institute-week3.rmd**
NOTE: The document title is not the same as the filename.
4. Hit the knit button in R studio (as is done in the video above). What happens?

If everything went well, you should have an html format (web page) output
after you hit the knit button. Note that this html output contains a combination
of code and documentation that you can write using markdown syntax.

change the appearance of your RStudio by **Tools** > **Options**
(or **Global Options** depending on operating system). For more, see the

{: .notice}

Let's next review the structure of an R Markdown (`.Rmd`) file. There are three
main content types:

* **Header:** the text at the top of the document, written in `YAML` format.
* **Markdown sections:** text that describes your workflow written using `markdown syntax`.
* **Code chunks:** Chunks of R code that can be run and also can be rendered
using knitr to an output document. 

Next let's explore each section type.

### Header -- YAML block

An R Markdown file always starts with header written using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML" target="_blank">`YAML` syntax</a>. 
There are four default elements in the RStudio generated YAML header: 

* **title:** the title of your document. NOTE: This is not the same as the file name.
* **author:** who wrote the document
* **date:** by default this is the date that the file is created.
* **output:** what format will the output be in. We will use HTML.

A YAML header may be structured differently depending upon how your are using it.
Learn more on the
<a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_quick_tour.html#output_options" target="_blank"> R Markdown documentation page</a>.

<div id="challenge" markdown="1">
## Activity: R Markdown YAML
Customize the header of your `.Rmd` file as follows: 

* **Title:** Provide a title that fits the code that will be in your RMD.  
* **Author:** Add your name here. 
* **Output:** Leave the default output setting: `html_document`. 
We will be rendering an HTML file.

</div>

### R Markdown Text / Markdown Blocks

An `Rmd` document contains a mixture of code chunks and markdown blocks where 
you can describe aspects of your processing workflow. The markdown blocks use the 
**same** markdown syntax that we learned in week 2 - last week. In these blocks
you might describe the data that you are using, how it's being processed and
and what the outputs are. You may even add some information that interprets
the outputs. 

When you render your document to HTML, this markdown will appear as text on the 
output html document.

### Explore Your Rmd File

Look closely at the pre-populated markdown and R code chunks in your `.Rmd` file. 
Does any of the markdown syntax look familiar?

* Are any words in bold?
* Are any words in italics?
* Are any words highlighted as code?


 <div id="challenge" markdown="1">
## Activity: R Markdown Text

1. Remove the template markdown and code chunks added to the RMD file by RStudio. 
(Be sure to keep the YAML header!)
2. At the very top of your `Rmd` document - after the YAML header, add
the bio and short research description that you wrote last week in markdown to
the Rmd file. 
3. Below your profile, add a header that says `About My Project` (or something
similar). 
4. Add text below that head that explains that this is a test page that demonstrates
using some of the NEON Teakettle LiDAR data products in R. The wording of this
text should clearly describe the code and outputs on the page.

</div>

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip**: You can add code output or an R object
name to markdown segments of an Rmd. For more, view this

### Code chunks

Code chunks are where your R code goes. All code chunks start and end with
<code>```</code>  -- three backticks or graves. On 
your keyboard, the backticks can be found on the same key as the tilde. 
`graves` are not the same as an apostrophe!

The initial line of a code chunk must appear as:

<pre><code> ```{r chunk-name-with-no-spaces} 
# code goes here
 ```</code></pre>

The `r` part of the chunk header identifies this chunk as an R code chunk and is 
mandatory. Next to the `{r}`, there is a chunk name. This name is not required 
for basic knitting however, it is good practice to give each chunk a unique 
name as it is required for more advanced knitting approaches. 

<div id="challenge" markdown="1">
## Activity: Add Code Chunks to Your Rmd File

*  Below the last section that you added above create a code chunk 
that loads the libraries required to work with raster data in R, and 
sets the working directory.

<pre><code>```{r setup-read-data }
   library(rgdal)
   library(raster)

   # set working directory to ensure R can find the file we wish to import
   setwd("~/Documents/data/data-institute-2016/")

 ```</code></pre>

* Add another chunk that loads a raster file.

<pre><code>```{r load-dsm-raster }

   # import dsm
   teak_dsm <- raster("NEONdata/TEAK/2013/lidar/Teak_lidarDSM.tif")
   
 ```</code></pre>

* Run the code in chunk one. 

You can run code chunks: 

* **Line-by-line:** with cursor on current line, Ctrl + Enter (Windows/Linux) or
Command + Enter (Mac OS X).
* **By chunk:** You can run the entire chunk (or multiple chunks) by
clicking on the `Chunks` dropdown button in the upper right corner of the script
environment and choosing the appropriate option. Keyboard shortcuts are
available for these options.

</div>

### Code chunk options

You can also add arguments or options to each code chunk. These arguments allow 
you to customize how or if you want code to be
processed or appear on the output HTML document. Code chunk arguments are added on 
the first line of a code
chunk after the name, within the curly brackets.

The example below, is a code chunk that will not be "run" or evaluated by R. 
The code within the chunk will appear on the output document however there
will be not outputs from the code.


<pre><code>```{r intro-option, eval=FALSE}
# the code here will not be processed by R 
# but it will appear on your output document
1+2
 ```</code></pre>

We use `eval=FALSE` often when the chunk is exporting an file that we don't
need to re-export but we want to document the code used to export the file.  


Three common code chunk options are:

* `eval = FALSE`: Do not **eval**uate (or run) this code chunk when
knitting the RMD document. The code in this chunk will still render in our knitted
html output, however it will not be evaluated or run by `R`.
* `echo=FALSE`: Hide the code in the output. The code is
evaluated when the RMD file is knit, however only the output is rendered on the 
output document.
* `results=hide`: The code chunk will be evaluated but the results or the code 
will not be rendered on the output document. This is useful if you are viewing the 
structure of a large object (e.g. outputs of a large `data.frame`).

Multiple code chunk options can be used for the same chunk. For more on code
chunk options, read
<a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_rcodechunks.html" target="_blank"> the RStudio documentation</a>
or the
<a href="http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/output/" target="_blank"> knitr documentation</a>.

## Activity: Add More Code to Your Rmd

Update your Rmd file as follows:

* Add a new code chunk. Within that chunk, add code that plots the `teak_dsm` raster object that you imported above. 
Experiment with plot colors and be sure to add a plot title. 
* Run the code chunk that you just added to your `.Rmd` document. Does it create a plot with a title?
* Create another new code chunk, import and plot another raster file from the NEON data subset 
that you downloaded. The `Teak_lidarCHM` is a good raster to plot.
* Finally, create histograms for both rasters that you've imported into R. 
* Be sure to document your steps as you go using both code `comments` and markdown
in between the code chunks.

For help, opening and plotting raster data in `R`, see the NEON Data Skills tutorial
