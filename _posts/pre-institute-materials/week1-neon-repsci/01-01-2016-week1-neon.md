Welcome to week one of the NEON Data Institute!

In week one, we will provide an overview of the National Ecological Observatory 
Network (NEON). Please carefully read through these materials and links that 
discuss NEON’s mission and design. As you review this information, please 
consider the 
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/tutorial-series/capstone" target="_blank">capstone project </a>
that you may want to work on at the Institute. 

At the end of week one, you will write out your initial research question idea
and required data that you will require to address that question at the 
Institute. 

<div id="objectives" markdown="1">
# Learning Objectives
At the end of this activity, you will be able to: 

* Explain the mission of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON).
* Explain the spatial design of NEON.
* Explain the different types of data that will be collected and provided by
 NEON.
* Find and download/request different types of NEON data. 
</div>

## NEON Mission & Overview

Please read this page on the NEON website to better understand 
<a href="http://www.neonscience.org/about" target="_blank">NEON’s mission</a>. 

Then, watch the XX minute overview video below.

## NEON Design
Watch the XX minute video to better understand the observatory’s design.

EMBED VIDEO: video 2 - spatial design of NEON

### Domains 
To capture ecological heterogeneity across the United States, NEON’s design 
divides the continent into 20 statistically “different” eco-climatic domains. 
Read this primer on 
<a href="http://www.neonscience.org/updates-events/update/primer-neon-sampling-design" target="_blank">NEON Sampling Design</a>.


### Field Sites
NEON field sites are located within each eco-climatic domain. Read more about 
the different types of 
<a href="http://www.neonscience.org/science-design/spatiotemporal-design" target="_blank">
field sites - core and relocatable - and their role in the NEON design</a>.

Explore the NEON Field Site map taking note of the locations of both aquatic vs terrestrial and core vs relocatable field sites.

* Click <a href="http://www.neonscience.org/science-design/field-sites" target="_blank">here to view the NEON Field Site Map</a>. 

Explore the field site map with the following tools: 

* Zoom & Domain Outlines: upper left corner
* Search/Filter: More in upper right
* Details of a given field site: click on the icon, then the field site name. 
This takes you to a new page with the field site details.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** You can download 
<a href="http://www.neonscience.org/science-design/field-sites/maps-spatial-data" target="_blank">maps, kmz, or shapefiles of the field sites here</a>.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Thought Questions:** Use the map above to answer 
these questions. Consider the research question that you may explore as your 
Capstone Project at the Institute OR about a current project that you are 
working on and answer the following questions:  
* Are there NEON field sites that are in study regions of interest to you?  
* What domains are the sites located in?  
* What NEON field sites do your current research or Capstone Project ideas 
coincide with?  
* Is the site(s) core or relocatable?  
* Is it/are they terrestrial or aquatic?  
* Are there data available for the NEON field site(s) that you are most 
interested in? What kind of data are available?
{: .notice .thought }

## The Data that NEON Collects

Read the 
<a href="http://www.neonscience.org/science-design/collection-methods" target="_blank"> Data Collection Methods </a>
page to learn more about the different types of data that NEON collects and 
provides. Then, read more about each collection method to better understand the 
types of NEON data that will be available.

### Airborne Remote Sensing 

Watch this 5 minute video (or the more technical video linked below) and read 
the following section to better understand the Airborne Observation Platform.

#### NEON Airborne Observation Platform (AOP)

or future research or the question you’d like to address at the Institute. 
Which types of data may be more useful to address these questions? 
What challenges, if any, could you foresee when beginning to work with these 
data?

## Get NEON Data

#### video title
VIDEO embed: NEON data processing and download 

### Data Processing
 All NEON data are processed at NEON headquarters in Boulder, CO. NEON provides 
processed and quality controlled data products. Read more about 
<a href="http://www.neonscience.org/science-design/data-processing" target="_blank">data processing at NEON </a>.
You will also learn more about this process during our week together in Boulder! 

NEON carefully documents every aspect of it’s design, data collection, 
processing and delivery. This documentation is freely available through the 
NEON data portal. Read more about <a href="http://www.neonscience.org/content/product-documentation" target="_blank"> data documentation</a>. 

## Data Portal
Many NEON data products are available through the 
<a href="http://data.neonscience.org/home" target="_blank">Data Portal</a>. 

NOTE: NEON is still in the construction phase. This means that not all data 
products are available at this time. Data are always coming online so be sure 
to check back for updates! 

If you are interested in the different types of data data that NEON will 
provide, check out the 
<a href="http://data.neonscience.org/data-product-catalog" target="_blank"> Data Product Catalog </a>. 

### Data By Request & Through Other Online Portals
Currently, not all NEON data are accessible through the data portal:

* <a href="http://www.neonscience.org/data-resources/get-data/airborne-data" target="_blank"> NEON AOP Data is available by request</a>. 
Data for some sites is now available for download.
* <a href="http://www.ibol.org/dna-barcodes-for-neons-terrestrial-insects/" target="_blank"> NEON Terrestrial Insect DNA Barcoding Data</a>
is available through the
<a href="http://www.boldsystems.org/index.php/databases" target="_blank"> Barcode of Life Datasystem (BOLD) </a>. 

### Specimens & Samples 
An overview of how to get data, soil or species samples, and supporting 
documentation can always be found on the 
<a href="http://www.neonscience.org/data-resources/get-data" target="_blank">Get Data page</a>. 

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Thought Questions:** 
Use the Data Portal tools to investigate the data availability for the field 
sites you’ve already identified in the previous Thought Questions. If your 
desired field site doesn’t have data available for it, choose the next most 
desirable one that does have data available.  
* What types of aquatic/terrestrial data are currently available? Remote sensing data?  
* Of these, what type of data are you most interested in working with for your project while at the Institute.  
* For what time period does the data cover?  
* What format is the downloadable file available in?  
* Where is the metadata to support this data?  
{: .notice .thought }

## What Data Are Available Now? 

You’re jumping into working with NEON data before the observatory is fully 
operational. This means that many sites are built but some are still in 
construction; much data has been collected but not all of it is available as a 
published data product. So what is available at this time? Check out the
<a href="http://www.neonscience.org/content/neon-glance" target="_blank"> NEON At-a-Glance page </a>
which is updated monthly to show the construction progress. 

Optional: An aspect of NEON that we won’t explore at the Institute is 
infrastructure that NEON provides to support your own research including 
proposals to fly the AOP over other study sites, a mobile tower/instrumentation 
setup and others. Learn more here the 
<a href="http://www.neonscience.org/data-resources/information-for-researchers" target="_blank">Assignable Assets programs </a>. 

## Week 1 Culmination Activity 

The Thought Questions throughout this week’s materials have led you to think 
about what NEON data you might be interested in using to address a research 
question for your Institute Capstone Project. 

For this week, write up a brief 
summary of a project that you might be interested in and list what data 
(NEON or other) would be needed to address this question. You will have time 
over the next few weeks to refine your idea, the goal here is to get you to 
start thinking of feasible ideas.
