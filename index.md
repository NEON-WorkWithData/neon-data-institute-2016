## Welcome to the 2016 NEON Data Institute!

NEON's Data Institute provides critical skills and foundational knowledge for
scientists working with heterogeneous
spatio-temporal data to address ecological questions. Our 2016 Institute focuses
on remote sensing of vegetation using open source tools and reproducible
science approaches.
