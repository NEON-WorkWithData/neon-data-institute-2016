{% include _toc.html %}

In this page, you will be introduced to the importance of version control in
scientific workflows.  

<div id="objectives" markdown="1">
# Learning Objectives
At the end of this activity, you will be able to:

* Explain what version control is and how it can be used.
* Explain why version control is important.
* Discuss the basics of how the Git version control system works.
* Discuss how GitHub can be used as a collaboration tool.

</div>

## What is Version Control?

A version control system maintains a record of changes to code and other content.
It also allows us to revert changes to a previous point in time.

You’ve probably used some workflow to track various iterations of a file,
in the past in the past.

## Types of Version control

There are many forms of version control. Some not as good:

* Save As with a new date (we’ve all done it, but it isn’t efficient)
* Google Docs have this as History (not bad for some documents, but limited in scope

Some better:

* Mercurial
* Subversion
* Git - which we’ll be learning much more about in this series.



<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Thought Question:** Do you currently implement
any form of version control in your work?

## Why Version Control is Important

Version control facilitates two important aspects of many scientific workflows:

1. The ability to save and review or revert to previous versions.
2. The ability to collaborate on a single project.

This means that you don’t have to worry about a collaborator (or your future self)
overwriting something important. It also allows two people working on the same
document a mechanism to efficient combine ideas and changes.

<div class="notice thought" markdown="1">
<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Thought Questions:** Think of a specific time when
you weren’t using version control that it would have been useful?  

* Why was version control needed?  
* What were the consequences of not having a version control system in place?
* What do you think would have been the result if you’d had an efficient version
control system in place?

## How Version Control Systems Works

### Simple Version Control Model

A version control system keeps track of what has changed in one or more files
over time. The way this tracking occurs, is slightly different between various
tools (e.g. git vs mercurial vs svn). However the principle is the same.

Version control systems start with a base version of the document and then save
just the submitted changes you make. You can think of version control as a
tape: if you rewind the tape and start at the base document, then you can play
back each change and end up with your latest version.

	</figcaption>
</figure>

Once you think of changes as separate from the document itself, you can then
think about “playing back” different sets of changes onto the base document
and getting different versions of the document. For example, two users can make
independent sets of changes based on the same document.

	</figcaption>
</figure>

If there aren’t conflicts -- areas where both users modified the same parts of
a document in different ways --, you can even review two sets of changes on the same
base document.

	</figcaption>
</figure>

A version control system is a tool that keeps track of these changes for us.
Each version of a file can viewed at any time and reverted to. That way if you
add something that you end up not liking or delete something that you need, you
can simply go back to a previous version.

### Git & GitHub - A Distributed Version Control Model

In a distributed model, like that used by GitHub, we still need to keep track of
any changes to a file or directory structure but this model has several
advantages:

* a Master version that is always the “current copy” that individual users can
add changes at different times. This allows for collaboration on the same files.
* a remote server which allows users in different locations to collaborate.

### Create A Working Copy of a Git Repo - Fork

allows users to contribute to the master repository through individual copies, 
or forks, of the repository.

There are many different Git/GitHub workflows. In the data institute, we will take
advantage of the distributed workflow that git allows where many people can be
working independently, on the same repository. Our collaborative workflow goes
like this:

* There is one master repository. Each participant in the data institute, will
 create a copy of this master repository in their own GitHub account. This is where you will do
you work!
* When you are ready to submit your changes to the master repository, you will:
   * Update the copy of the master in your account, with the master in NEON's account. This is called (syncing)
   * Push the changes you made to your copy or FORK of the master repository -  
   to the master repository.

Let's get some terms straight before we go any further.

* **Master repository** - The master repository is what all contributors  will
add to. It is the "final working version" of the project.
* User’s **forked repository** - each user has a “personal” working copy of the
master repository stored in their local GitHub account. This is called the fork.
This is your “working copy” of the repository. When you are happy with your work,
you can sync your repo with the master. Then you can update the master repository.
* User’s **local repository** - this is a local version of your fork on your
own computer. You will most often edit content locally.


<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** Other Workflows -- If you chose to
implement Git/GitHub in your work, know that other workflows are common.
<a href="<https://ru.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow" target="_blank">This page details some of those workflows that you might want to consider </a>.
This resource mentions Bitbucket, another web-based hosting service
like GitHub. We recommend you consider alternate workflows only after
understanding the one we use in the Institute.
