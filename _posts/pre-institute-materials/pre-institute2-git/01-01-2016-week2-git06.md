This tutorial covers how to sync files between your local copy of a git repo,
your forked github.com version and the master repo.

<div id="objectives" markdown="1">
# Learning Objectives
At the end of this activity, you will be able to:

* Explain the concept of base fork and head fork.
* Know how to transfer changes (sync) between repos in GitHub.
* Explain why it is important to update a local repo before beginning edits.
* Update your local repository from your fork on GitHub.
* Create a Pull Request on the GitHub.com website.

We now have done the following:

1. We've **forked** (made an individual copy of) the NEON-WorkWithData/DI16-NEON-participants repo to 
our github.com account.
2. We've **cloned** the forked repo - making a copy of it on our local computers
3. We've added files and content to the repo and **committed** the changes
4. We've **pushed** those changes back up to the forked repo on github.com

In this tutorial, we will learn how to transfer these changes from our forked
repo in our github.com account to the master NEON repository. The
transfer of information between two repositories in GitHub is done using a 
**pull request**.

EMBED GRAPHIC: GitHub Workflow basic - highlighting PR section

We will go through each step in the typical workflow for syncing repos:

1. Update fork from the master (Pull Request) 
2. Update local from the fork (`git pull`)
3. Push changes from local to fork (`git push`)
4. Update the master from the fork (Pull Request)

This order is important as it ensures that you incorporate any changes that have
been made to the master repository into your fork & local repositories prior to 
adding changes to the master. If you do not sync in this order, you risk creating
a **merge conflict**. This occurs when two users edit the same part of a file 
at the same time. Git can't determine which edit occurred first or last so it 
cannot create a snapshot of the most current version.

In the last tutorial, we taught you to push immediately after committing changes, 
this was so you would immediately see those changes in the repository. In a 
typical workflow, you should always update from the master repository first. 

## Status of a Repository

Notice in the screenshot above that there is a a line that says:

`This branch is 2 commits behind NEON-WorkWithData:gh-pages`

This message tells us that this particular fork, which is located in `mjones01/`
account, is **behind** the master institute repository.

**What this means:** If a fork is **behind** another repository, it means that 
someone has made changes to the other repository that you do not have in your 
fork. The two repositories are **out of sync**.

This message allows you to see the status of your current fork relative to the 
repo it was forked from. Prior to pushing the changes that you made in your fork 
of the master repository, it is important to ensure that your fork is synced 
(it has the most recent changes from the master repository).

We can use a pull request to sync the two repositories.

## Pull Requests in GitHub

### Update Your Fork from Master

*This section, with modifications, is borrowed from
<a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#pr" target="_blank"> the GitHub Hello World guide</a>.
They provide an animated version of these directions.*

To avoid problems with merging later, you want to update your fork from
the master repository. Do this by creating a new pull request. Pull Requests are
the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you’re
proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your
contribution and merge them into their project.

Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both repositories.
The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.

#### Step 1 - Start Pull Request
Click the Pull Request tab, then from the Pull Request page, click the 
"New pull request" button.

#### Step 2 - Choose Repos to Update
Select your fork to compare with master repo. Here we want to add any changes
in the master repo to your fork. You must select the correct head and base to
ensure that the changes are being added to the correct repo.

**Head vs base**

* Base - repository that will be updated, the changes will be added to this repo.
* Head - repository from which the changes come.

One way to remember this is that the “head” is always a*head* of the base, so
we must add from the head to the base.

The head and base will automatically populate with your fork as the base and the
repository from which you forked it as the base. This is great for when you want
to update FROM our master Institute repository but backward of what we want when
we want to update our forks.

To switch the head and base, you need to change one of them and then click
“compare across forks” to be able to select the other one.

#### Step 3 - Verify Changes
Look over your changes in the diffs on the Compare page, make sure they’re what
you want to submit.

#### Step 4 - Create Pull Request
When you’re satisfied that these are the changes you want to submit, click the
big green Create Pull Request button.

#### Step 5 - Title Pull Request
Give your pull request a title and write a brief description of your changes.
When you’re done with your message, click Create pull request!

Check out the repo name up at the top, when creating the Pull Request you will
be automatically transferred to the base repo. Since your fork was the base
(we are updating it), we are still there.

#### Step 6 - Merge Pull Request
In this final step, it’s time to bring your changes together – merging any
changes the master repo with your forked repo.

If you have permissions in the repo, which you do since this is your repo, click
the green "Merge Pull Request" button to merge the changes into the master repo.
Then click Confirm Merge.

We now have made sure that our forked repository is synced with any changes
that might have occurred in the master Institute repo since we created (or
last synced) it. Now we need to update our local repo with any changes.

## Update Local Repo
Prior to starting a new round of edits in or pushing new edits from your local 
repository, you always want to update it with any changes from collaborators. 

Using bash we navigate to the desired directory and then use `git pull` to sync
our local repo with the forked GitHub repo.

First, navigate to the desired directory

    $ cd ~/Documents/GitHub/DI16-NEON-participants

Second, update local repo

    $ git pull

    remote: Counting objects: 25, done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (15/15), done.
    remote: Total 25 (delta 16), reused 19 (delta 10), pack-reused 0
    Unpacking objects: 100% (25/25), done.
    From https://github.com/mjones01/DI16-NEON-participants
        74d9b7b..463e6f0  gh-pages   -> origin/gh-pages
    Auto-merging _posts/institute-materials/example.md


**Understand the output:**
The output will change with every update, several things to look for in the output:

* `remote: …`: tells you how many items have changed.
* `From https:URL`: which remote repository is data being pulled from. For the
Institute, it should always be your fork of the Institute repo.
* Section with + and - : this visually shows you which documents are updated
and the types of edits (additions/deletions) that were made.

Now that everything is updated you can push your commits up to the fork. Unless
you've change your bio since we last pushed it, you probably don't have any 
commits to push -- but remember, in a typical workflow we would have synced the 
repos before pushing. 

    $ git push origin gh-pages

Now you commits are added to your forked repository. 

### Update from Your Fork to the Master
Now we need to repeat the pull request steps, but change the base and head so 
that the transfer of data occurs in the other direction - from our fork to the 
master Institute repository.

Repeat the pull request steps above, with the base and head switched.

When you get to Step 6 - Merge Pull Request, what happens?

You can only merge if you have permissions in the base repo that you are adding
to, at this point you don’t have contributor permissions. Instead someone who is 
a contributor on the repository will need to review and accept the request.

## Summary Workflow -- Syncing Repos with Pull Requests
In GitHub

  + Button: Create Pull Request
  + Button: Merge Pull Request

In Bash

* Update your Local Repo & Push Changes
  + `git pull` - pull down any changes and sync the local repo with your fork
  + `git push origin gh-pages` - push your changes up to your fork

In GitHub

* Update from Your Fork to the Master
  * Button: Create New Pull Request
