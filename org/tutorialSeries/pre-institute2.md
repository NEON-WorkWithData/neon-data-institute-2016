## Welcome to pre-Institute Week 2

This week our goal is to ensure that everyone comes to the Institute ready to 
work in a collaborative research environment. One aspect of the collaboration 
will be to share code and use version control to track changes to projects 
throughout the Institute (and we hope, in your own work after the Institute). 
To do this, we will be using Git and GitHub throughout the Institute. 

This series provides information on what version control is and why it is 
important, and then teaches you how to use Git and GitHub in the workflow we 
will use at the 2016 NEON Data Institute. 

## Week 2 Activity
The materials below will walk you through the activity. In brief, you will revise
you project summary from last week and submit it via GitHub. This will allow us
to begin collecting the data you will need to complete your project so that it 
is ready for you when you arrive. 

Please complete by 11:59 Thursday June 9th.
